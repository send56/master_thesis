    %Simulation is a necessary tool of modern particle physics experiments, serving as a bridge between experiment and theory, therefore playing a critical role in both the analysis of experimental data and the validation of theoretical models. By accurately modeling particle interactions and detector responses, simulations enable reliable predictions of signal and background processes, optimization of detector performance, and evaluation of systematic uncertainties. thereby supporting the overall success of the research.


    The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), operated by CERN, is the highest-energy proton-proton collider in the world. One of its main detectors, ATLAS, is a general-purpose detector located at one of the collision points and is designed for studying of fundamental physics searching for phenomena beyond the Standard Model. With the upcoming Phase-II upgrade to High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) in 2030, the ATLAS trigger system will be upgraded in response to the significantly increased luminosity. Along with this upgrade, as a part of the muon trigger system in the endcap region, the TGC (Thin Gap Chamber) detector, will have all its electronics renewed in HL-LHC. My research focuses on the development of a software simulator for the TGC Sector Logic, which is responsible for outputting the muon transverse momentum based on hits information on TGC, and on its integration and testing within the ATLAS software framework, Athena.

    The main problem of the integration on Athena is that directly integrating the existing software algorithm would cause a huge memory usage that substantially exceeds Athenaâ€™s limits. To address this problem, a simple emulator for the muon trigger was first developed to support downstream developments in the muon trigger chain. After that, in order to reproduce the trigger logic as the firmware does, and thereby to achieve a higher precision, the development of the simulator for TGC Sector Logic was performed based on an existing bitwise simulator. The development includes the local implementation on Athena and an optimization of memory reduction. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation with performance evaluation was carried out for the implemented simulator.
