\chapter{Development of a Simple Emulator for L0 Muon Trigger System} \label{ch:L0MuonEmulator}
%====================================================================================================
This chapter introducts the development of a simple emulator emulating the L0 muon trigger behavior on both barrel and endcap region, called L0MuonEmulator. The L0Muon-Emulator is a C++ based software package on Athena that emulates the trigger decision for muons as a part of L0 trigger system for HL-LHC. The L0MuonEmulator makes decisions of whether a muon candidate should be accepted or rejected based on a pre-set step function of transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}$, and then smears the $p_\mathrm{T}$, as an emulation of detector response due to the momentum resolution of the detectors. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the emulator's design and logic. Since the simulation based solely on smearing was insufficient to replicate the actual trigger logic, we introduce an implementation of a detailed masking procedure to make the trigger performance closer to the reality. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the emulator and discuss about the need for a more precise simulation approach.

\section{Purpose and Function of the Simple Emulator} \label{sec:L0MuonPurpose}
%====================================================================================================
Figure~\ref{fig:L0_trigger_chain} shows the prospective trigger chain for Phase-II L0 muon trigger simulation on Athena. The \textit{Level-0 TGC Sector Logic} package, on which this research is focusing, provides muon $p_\mathrm{T}$ and ROI (Region Of Interest) information to the downstream package, \textit{Level-0 MDT Trigger-Processor}, for further calculation. The purpose of the L0MuonEmulator in this chapter, is to provide a temporary input interface for the next simulation of \textit{Level-0 MDT Trigger-Processor}, before the actual implementation of \textit{Level-0 TGC Sector Logic}. At present, the emulator takes as input the \\\texttt{xAOD::TruthParticleContainer} containing all generated particles in a simulated Monte Carlo event and selects only final-state muons (and anti-particles). These selected muons are then passed through a smearing and filtering procedure that models the detector resolution and trigger efficiency, providing a collection of RoI information based on the emulated L0 muon trigger, stored in an data container \texttt{xAOD::MuonRoIContainer}. Each RoI contains information on transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$), pseudorapidity ($\eta$), azimuthal angle ($\phi$), and charge.

The filtering function in the L0MuonEmulator simulates the trigger efficiency as a function of muon transverse momentum. A simplified step-function model is implemented, in which muons below a certain threshold are discarded, while muons above that threshold are accepted with an efficiency of 95\%. This 95\% efficiency is approximately determined based on the efficiency of endcap in L1 muon trigger in Run~3 and the efficiency of barrel simulated for Phase-II upgrade, which will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:L0MuonEmulatorPerformance}. In addition, the emulator includes a basic geometric masking procedure to exclude regions outside the muon detector acceptance. Currently, this is implemented by discarding all truth muons with pseudorapidity $|\eta| > 2.41$, which roughly corresponds to the coverage limit of the L0 muon trigger chambers in ATLAS. Truth muons outside this region are automatically rejected.

The smearing algorithm emulates the detector resolution by applying a smearing function to the inverse transverse momentum ($q/p_\mathrm{T}$) of the selected muons. Currently, a Gaussian distribution is used as the smearing function, tentatively with a width of 5\% of the input $q/p_\mathrm{T}$. The $\eta$ and $\phi$ positions are not smeared at this stage, as the RoI granularity is coarser than the smearing scale, thereby dominates the uncertainty. Once smeared, the kinematic variables are encoded into a bit-wise RoI word format compatible with the hardware-level representation used in the ATLAS trigger system.

In addition, the L0MuonEmulator provides a monitoring infrastructure based on the Athena Monitoring Framework. A series of histograms are produced during the execution to validate the emulator output against the input truth muon properties. These include distributions of $\eta$, $\phi$, $p_\mathrm{T}$, and $q/p_\mathrm{T}$ before and after smearing, as well as resolution plots such as $\Delta\eta$, $\Delta\phi$, and relative $p_\mathrm{T}$ deviation. These features support the evaluation of trigger-level muon reconstruction quality. Below is a summary table of the output histograms and their corresponding physical meaning.

\section{Muon Trigger Acceptence at Phase-II Upgrade} \label{sec:MuonTriggerAcceptance}
%====================================================================================================
As discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:ATLAS}, at the barrel region of the ATLAS detector, there are some dead zones in the RPC detector, affecting the trigger acceptance and efficiency. Therefore, a new station of RPC detector in the BI region will be added in Phase-II upgrade. This additional RPC0 enables a four-layer RPC configuration and allows for more flexible coincidence schemes. A summary of the logic combinations is provided in Table~\ref{tab:RPC_coincidence_modes}. Three coincidence schemes are considered as ``3/3 chambers'', ``3/4 chambers'', and ``3/4 chambers + BI-BO'', which are defined by the number of required stations to register hits of the barrel detector. 

The performance of muon trigger acceptance in barrel region for ``3/3 chambers''in Run~3  are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:trigger_acceptance_3_3}. Figure~\ref{fig:trigger_acceptance_3_4} and Figure~\ref{fig:trigger_acceptance_3_4_BI_BO} shows the acceptance for ``3/4 chambers'', and ``3/4 chambers + BI-BO'' schemes in Run~4, respectively. From these pictures, we can see, the trigger acceptance gradually improves through the Phase-II upgrade, with the highest coverage achieved in the “3/4 chambers + BI-BO” pattern.

\section{Simulation for the trigger acceptance} 
%====================================================================================================
Section~\ref{sec:MuonTriggerAcceptance} above shows that even applying the coincidence scheme with highest acceptance, some unavoidable holes remain due to persistent mechanical limitations. In this section, a simple simulation that simulates the barrel muon trigger acceptance in Run~4 are implemented. This simulation emulates the ``holes'' caused by mechanical structures based on the ``3/4 chambers + BI-BO'' scheme, which shows the highest coverage, to emulate the acceptance based on spatial dependence on $(\eta, \phi)$ plane of muons.

As described in Section~\ref{sec:L0MuonPurpose}, the original implementation adopted a simplified geometric acceptance cut by discarding all truth muons with pseudorapidity $|\eta| > 2.41$, roughly corresponding to the nominal detector coverage of the L0 muon chambers. To further filter those ``holes'', specific $(\eta, \phi)$ masking scheme corresponding to uncovered regions are manually excluded within the smearing algorithm, as Figure~\ref{fig:masking} shows, in which those area enclosed by blue dashed lines reflect the masking regions.

\section{Performance of the L0MuonEmulator} \label{sec:L0MuonEmulatorPerformance}
%====================================================================================================
In this section, the efficiency performance of the L0MuonEmulator is carried out, with the references of the trigger efficiency in Run~3 for endcap, and Run~4 for barrel with higher efficiency being performed. These evaluations uses the Monte Carlo sample of $Z \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ events at a center-of-mass energy of $13.6\,\mathrm{TeV}$, with a total of $60{,}000$ events.

Figure~\ref{fig:L1MuonEndcapEff} and Figure~\ref{fig:L0MuonBarrelEff} give the muon trigger efficiency distributions of $p_\mathrm{T}$ in the endcap and barrel regions, respectively, with various $p_\mathrm{T}$ thresholds. While Figure~\ref{fig:eff_pt_endcap} and Figure~\ref{fig:eff_pt_barrel} show the efficiencies of the L0MuonEmulator in endcap and barrel regions with five thresholds. From them, it can be concluded that, although the turn-on curves are not clearly observed, the efficiency performances reproduced by L0MuonEmulator show good agreement with the references.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:eta_phi_comparison} gives the two-dimensional $(\eta, \phi)$ acceptance maps: the reference map from Phase-II trigger studies (top) and the efficiency map generated by L0MuonEmulator (bottom). Dashed blue boxes in the panel below indicate the manually masked regions like Figure~\ref{fig:masking}. Only obvious region around $\eta = 0$ and $|\eta| = 0.7$ are qualitatively reproduced, while other smaller inefficienciy regions are not reproduced. As a result, the ``holes'' are well simulated by the masking scheme, especially those area around $\eta = 0$. Those regions with efficieny over 90\% are reliably reproduced.

\end{figure}

In conclusion, according to the efficiency performance on both $p_\mathrm{T}$ and $(\eta, \phi)$ plane, despite of the good efficiency performance on $p_\mathrm{T}$ and improved realism by implemented region masking, it yet remains incapability to reproduce physical phenomena, since it does not simulate the trigger logic at all. Therefore, a complete simulator of high precision that simulates the trigger logic in full detail is still necessary for the Athena implementation. This motivates the development of the simulator for TGC Sector Logic, which will be introduced in the next chapter.
