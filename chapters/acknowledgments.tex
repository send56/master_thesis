I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof.~Junpei Maeda and Prof.~Yuji Yamazaki, who have continuously guided and supported my research throughout my master’s program. Their patience, encouragement, and insightful advice were crucial to the completion of this thesis. Prof.~Junpei Maeda provided continuous technical guidance and encouragement during the most challenging phases of my research. Prof.~Yuji Yamazaki, as my supervisor, guided the overall direction of my study and provided detailed feedback on this thesis. Without their support, the completion of this thesis would have been impossible.

I would like to thank Prof.~Hisaya Kurashige from Kobe ATLAS group for his guidance during weekly meetings and for his kind assistance in discussions related to physics. I would also like to express my gratitude to other teachers in our research room: Prof.~Yasuo Takeuchi, Prof.~Kentaro Miuchi, Prof.~Atsumu Suzuki, Prof.~Hiroshi Ito, Dr.~Satoshi Higashino, for their assistance during my presentations and colloquiums.

I am grateful to Prof.~Susumu Okubo and Prof.~Junpei Maeda for taking the time to review my thesis as secondary examiners, despite their busy schedules.

Also, I would like to thank members of the other groups in the research room, whose presence added cheerfulness to my research life.

I would like to acknowledge the staff members of the ATLAS Japan group: Yasuyuki Okumura, Yasuyuki Horii, Shota Izumiyama, Yuki Sue, and Masato Aoki, for their valuable help and advice. I would also like to thank students of the ATLAS Japan group in ICEPP: Erika Yamashita, Airu Makita, Towa Mizuochi, and Kazuma Maki, who continuously shared their research progress.
